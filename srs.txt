System Requirements Specification (SRS)
Project Title: Online Learning Management System
Project Number: LMS-2023-01
Date: [Insert Date]

1. Scope
The purpose of this system is to provide an online platform for managing educational content, user authentication, course management, and reporting tools. The system will be web-based and accessible from any device with internet connectivity.

2. High-Level Requirements
Functional Requirements:
User Authentication:

Implement secure user authentication using OAuth2.
Support email accounts and social media login (e.g., Google, Facebook).
Provide multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an optional feature.
Course Management:

Create and manage courses with flexibility to add or remove modules.
Enable creation of multiple user roles (e.g., Student, Instructor).
Allow assignment of courses to users based on their roles.
Content Delivery:

Support upload of multimedia files (videos, PDFs, images).
Implement file versioning and access control for content.
Enable search functionality across course materials.
Reporting and Analytics:

Generate detailed reports on student performance, attendance, and engagement.
Provide dashboards for monitoring course progress and activity logs.
Mobile Accessibility:

Ensure the system is mobile-friendly and accessible via smartphones and tablets.
Offer push notifications for new updates or course availability.
Administrative Tools:

Provide tools for managing users, courses, and content.
Include backup and recovery features for user data.
Non-Functional Requirements:
Performance:

Ensure the system can handle up to [X] concurrent users without performance degradation.
Optimize for fast loading times of course materials and dashboards.
Availability:

The system should be available 24/7 with minimal downtime.
Usability:

Provide an intuitive user interface (UI) that is easy to navigate.
Support keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility.
Security Requirements:
Data Protection:

Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit using HTTPS.
Implement password reset functionality with secure storage of reset tokens.
Access Control:

Restrict access to course materials based on user roles (e.g., Student, Instructor).
Ensure audit logging for all system activities.
Compliance:

Comply with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
Integration Requirements:
API Integration:
Provide APIs for third-party integrations (e.g., Google Classroom, Moodle).
3. System Architecture
Layers:
Client Layer:

Web interface with mobile app.
User authentication and session management.
Server Layer:

Content storage, user database, and API gateway.
Database Layer:

Relational database for user information and content storage (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
API Layer:

RESTful APIs for data exchange between components.
Business Logic Layer:

Logic for course management, content moderation, and reporting.
Key Dependencies:
[Cloud Platform]: For hosting services.
[Integration Services]: For third-party API calls.
4. Key Functional Features
User Management:

Create and edit user accounts with roles (Student, Instructor).
Course Creation:

Add modules, set start/end dates, and publish courses.
Content Moderation:

Approve or reject content submissions by moderators.
File Upload:
