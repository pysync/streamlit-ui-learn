Okay, let's analyze the state management specifically for your `WorkingSpacePage`, focusing on what needs to be stored and centralized, the APIs involved, and user interactions.

**I. State Variables and Centralization for `WorkingSpacePage`**

We'll categorize states into Workspace-Level (centralized) and Tab-Specific (local).

**A. Workspace-Level State (Centralized in `WorkspaceContext`)**

These states are essential for the entire `WorkingSpacePage` and should be accessible across different tabs and components.

1.  **`currentWorkspace`**:
    *   **Data:** Object representing the currently selected `Workspace` (ID, title, description, etc.).
    *   **Centralization Rationale:**  Every tab within `WorkingSpacePage` operates within the context of the current workspace. Components need to know which workspace they are working in to fetch related artifacts and data.
    *   **API:**
        *   `GET /workspaces/{workspaceId}` (to fetch workspace details when `WorkingSpacePage` loads)
    *   **User Interactions:**
        *   Workspace selection from the Workspaces List page (sets this state when navigating to `WorkingSpacePage`).

2.  **`artifacts`**:
    *   **Data:** Array of `Artifact` objects belonging to the `currentWorkspace`.
    *   **Centralization Rationale:** Artifacts are the core data entities. The list of artifacts is displayed in the sidebar and accessed by various tabs (Project Plan notes, SRS document, design artifacts). Centralizing ensures consistency across the application.
    *   **API:**
        *   `GET /artifacts/?workspace_id={workspaceId}` (to fetch artifacts for the current workspace)
        *   `POST /artifacts/` (to create new artifacts)
        *   `PUT /artifacts/{document_id}/update` (to update artifact versions)
        *   `DELETE /artifacts/{artifact_id}` or `/artifacts/document/{document_id}` (to delete artifacts)
    *   **User Interactions:**
        *   Loading `WorkingSpacePage` (initial fetch).
        *   Creating a new artifact (updates the list).
        *   Updating an artifact (updates the list and individual artifact content).
        *   Deleting an artifact (removes from the list).
        *   Filtering or searching artifacts in the sidebar (updates the displayed list, but not the central `artifacts` state directly - could be a derived state).

3.  **`selectedArtifact` (Optional - Consider if needed centrally)**
    *   **Data:**  Currently selected `Artifact` object from the artifact list sidebar.
    *   **Centralization Rationale:** If you want to reflect the selected artifact across tabs (e.g., if selecting an artifact in the sidebar should automatically open it in a relevant tab), then centralizing `selectedArtifact` is beneficial. If tabs operate more independently, this can be tab-local.
    *   **API:**  `GET /artifacts/{artifact_id}` or `GET /artifacts/current/{document_id}` (to fetch full artifact content when selected).
    *   **User Interactions:**
        *   Clicking on an artifact in the sidebar list.

**B. Tab-Specific State (Component-Local State - `useState` within each Tab component)**

These states are primarily relevant to the specific tab and don't necessarily need to be shared broadly.

**Tab 1: Project Plan ("ProjectPlanTab" component)**

1.  **`ideaNotesMarkdownContent`**:
    *   **Data:** String - content of the Markdown editor for idea notes.
    *   **Local Rationale:** Markdown content for idea notes is specific to this tab.
    *   **API:**
        *   Potentially `POST /artifacts/` or `PUT /artifacts/{document_id}/update` (when saving idea notes as an "Idea Note" Artifact).
        *   Could also be saved as part of the `Workspace` itself if it's just initial workspace description, but Artifacts are more flexible.
    *   **User Interactions:**
        *   Typing in the Markdown editor.
        *   "AI Gen/Improve" button click (updates the content).
        *   Saving the notes as an artifact.

2.  **`excalidrawScene`**:
    *   **Data:** Object - Excalidraw scene data (JSON).
    *   **Local Rationale:** Excalidraw scene is specific to the wireframing activity in this tab.
    *   **API:**
        *   Potentially `POST /artifacts/` or `PUT /artifacts/{document_id}/update` (when saving wireframes as an "Wireframe" Artifact).
    *   **User Interactions:**
        *   Drawing and manipulating elements in Excalidraw.
        *   "AI Generate Diagram" button click (updates the scene based on AI).
        *   Saving the wireframe as an artifact.

3.  **`backlogItems`**:
    *   **Data:** Array of objects representing backlog items (tasks/features). Could be more structured if needed (status, priority, assigned milestone, linked artifacts).
    *   **Local Rationale:** While backlog items are related to the project, the *display and interaction* with the backlog are primarily within the "Project Plan" tab. You *could* centralize this if you plan to access/modify the backlog from other tabs, but local management is simpler initially.
    *   **API:**
        *   `GET /backlog/?workspace_id={workspaceId}` (if you decide to persist backlog items separately from artifacts - which might be a good idea for more structured backlog management).
        *   `POST /backlog/` (create backlog item)
        *   `PUT /backlog/{backlogItemId}` (update backlog item)
        *   `DELETE /backlog/{backlogItemId}` (delete backlog item)
    *   **User Interactions:**
        *   Adding new backlog items.
        *   Dragging and dropping items to change status.
        *   Editing backlog item details.
        *   Linking backlog items to artifacts.

**Tab 2: Requirements ("RequirementsTab" component)**

1.  **`srsMarkdownContent`**:
    *   **Data:** String - content of the structured Markdown editor for the SRS document.
    *   **Local Rationale:** SRS document content is specific to this tab.
    *   **API:**
        *   `POST /artifacts/` or `PUT /artifacts/{document_id}/update` (when saving SRS document as "SRS Document" Artifact).
    *   **User Interactions:**
        *   Typing in the structured Markdown editor.
        *   "AI Gen/Improve SRS Section" button click.
        *   Exporting the SRS document.
        *   Saving the SRS document as an artifact.

2.  **`requirementsList`**:
    *   **Data:** Array of objects representing structured requirements (Requirement ID, Description, Type, Priority, Linked Artifacts, etc.).
    *   **Local Rationale:**  Displaying and interacting with the requirements table is primarily within this tab.  Similar to backlog, you could centralize if needed, but local is simpler to start.
    *   **API:**
        *   `GET /requirements/?workspace_id={workspaceId}` (if persisting requirements separately).
        *   `POST /requirements/` (create requirement)
        *   `PUT /requirements/{requirementId}` (update requirement)
        *   `DELETE /requirements/{requirementId}` (delete requirement)
    *   **User Interactions:**
        *   Adding new requirements to the table.
        *   Editing requirements in the table.
        *   Filtering, sorting, searching the table.
        *   Linking requirements to artifacts or backlog items.

**Tab 3: Basic Design ("BasicDesignTab" component - and its sub-tabs)**

*   **"Screen Maps" Sub-tab:**
    *   **`screenMapDiagramData`**: (Data for `react-flow` or similar diagramming library). Local state. API for saving/loading "Screen Map" Artifact.
*   **"API List" Sub-tab:**
    *   **`apiList`**: (Array of API objects). Local state. API for saving/loading "API List" Artifact.
*   **"ER Diagram" Sub-tab:**
    *   **`erDiagramData`**: (Data for Excalidraw or Mermaid text). Local state. API for saving/loading "ER Diagram" Artifact.
*   **"Diagrams" Sub-tab:**
    *   **`sequenceDiagramText`**, **`activityDiagramText`**, **`systemOverviewDiagramText`**: (Strings - Mermaid text or similar). Local state. APIs for saving/loading "Sequence Diagram", "Activity Diagram", "System Overview Diagram" Artifacts.

For all sub-tabs in "Basic Design":

*   **Local Rationale:**  Diagram and list data are specific to each sub-tab.
*   **API:**  `POST /artifacts/`, `PUT /artifacts/{document_id}/update` for saving each design artifact type.  Potentially `GET /artifacts/?workspace_id={workspaceId}&art_type={artifactType}` to load existing design artifacts of specific types for the workspace.
*   **User Interactions:**
    *   Using diagramming tools, editing tables, text editors within each sub-tab.
    *   "AI Suggest/Generate" buttons within each sub-tab.
    *   Saving design artifacts.

**II. Interactive Actions and Context**

Here's a list of key user interactive actions and the context they operate within:

*   **Workspace Selection (Workspaces List Page):**
    *   Action: User clicks on a workspace in the list.
    *   Context:  Navigating to `WorkingSpacePage` for the selected workspace. Sets `currentWorkspace` in `WorkspaceContext`.
*   **Artifact Sidebar Interactions (`WorkingSpacePage`):**
    *   Action: Clicking on an artifact in the sidebar list.
    *   Context: Potentially sets `selectedArtifact` in `WorkspaceContext` (if you centralize it), highlights the artifact in the sidebar.
    *   Action: Filtering/searching artifacts in sidebar.
    *   Context: Updates the displayed list in the sidebar (UI state, not necessarily centralized data).
    *   Action: "Create New Artifact" button click in sidebar.
    *   Context: Opens a modal to create a new artifact. Upon save, updates the `artifacts` list in `WorkspaceContext`.
*   **Markdown Editor Interactions (Project Plan, Requirements Tabs):**
    *   Action: Typing, formatting text.
    *   Context: Updating local `markdownContent` state.
    *   Action: Selecting text in editor -> Right-click -> Context Menu actions ("Make as API List Entry", "Ask AI", etc.).
    *   Context:  Triggers specific actions based on context menu selection (e.g., "Make as API List Entry" might open a modal pre-filled with selected text to create a new API artifact). "Ask AI" sends selected text to AI service.
    *   Action: "AI Gen/Improve" button click.
    *   Context: Sends current editor content to AI service, updates `markdownContent` state with AI response.
*   **Excalidraw Interactions (Project Plan, Basic Design Tabs):**
    *   Action: Drawing, manipulating elements.
    *   Context: Updating local `excalidrawScene` state.
    *   Action: "AI Generate Diagram" button click.
    *   Context: Sends some context (e.g., notes from Markdown editor, requirements) to AI service, updates `excalidrawScene` state with AI-generated diagram data.
    *   Action: Selecting elements in Excalidraw -> Right-click -> Context Menu actions ("Make as Artifact", "Ask AI", etc.).
    *   Context: Similar to Markdown editor context menu, triggers actions based on selection.
*   **Backlog Board Interactions (Project Plan Tab):**
    *   Action: Dragging and dropping backlog items.
    *   Context: Updates local `backlogItems` state (order, status). Potentially triggers API call to update backlog item status if persisting backlog separately.
    *   Action: Editing backlog item details (card click -> modal).
    *   Context: Opens a modal to edit backlog item details, upon save, updates `backlogItems` state and potentially calls API to update.
*   **Table Interactions (Requirements, API List, Core Entities List Tabs):**
    *   Action: Sorting, filtering, searching table.
    *   Context: Updates table UI (client-side filtering/sorting, or potentially server-side filtering if data is large).
    *   Action: Inline editing of table cells, adding/deleting rows.
    *   Context: Updates local table data state (`requirementsList`, `apiList`, etc.) and potentially calls APIs to create, update, or delete data.

**III. Summary of State and API Strategy**

*   **Centralize Key Workspace Data:**  `currentWorkspace` and `artifacts` (and potentially `selectedArtifact`) in `WorkspaceContext`. This ensures data consistency and accessibility across `WorkingSpacePage`.
*   **Local State for Tab-Specific Data:** Manage editor content, diagram data, and table data locally within each tab component using `useState`. This keeps components focused and reduces unnecessary re-renders.
*   **API Driven Persistence:** Use APIs to fetch, create, update, and delete artifacts, workspaces, and potentially backlog items and requirements (if you choose to persist them separately).
*   **Context Menus for AI and Artifact Creation:** Leverage context menus for initiating AI actions and quickly creating new artifacts from selected text or diagram elements.

This detailed state and API analysis should provide a solid foundation for building your `WorkingSpacePage` and ensuring a well-structured and maintainable application. Remember to start with the core functionality and iterate, adding features and complexity as needed.
